Costs
Currently the SIM costs around £2,000 a month for maintenance and development work, this can be drastically reduced as we’re planning to move the work in-house. 
Hosting costs – low as we’re planning on doing all the calculations ourselves, as opposed to what the SIM currently does where it calculates as you go.
Using Github pages is free, but a custom domain name will cost around £10 a month.
Other than that, I currently can’t see any other costs to add to this other than a premium github account at approximately $21 a month but this doesn’t feel necessary at the moment as I’m the only developer.

Progress so far (will be updated accordingly)
-	Progress document setup
-	Basic Lo-Fi wireframe created
-	Made NSAR github account
-	Setup Master SIM repository (https://github.com/nsaruk/master)
